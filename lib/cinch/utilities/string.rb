      # This method is useful for filtering text from external sources
      # before sending it to IRC.
      #
      # Note that this method does not gracefully handle mIRC color
      # codes, because it will leave the numeric arguments behind. If
      # your text comes from IRC, you may want to filter it through
      # {strip_colors} first. If you want to send sanitized input that
      # includes your own formatting, first use this method, then add
      # your formatting.
      #
      # There exist methods for sending messages that automatically
      # call this method, namely {Target#safe_msg},
      # {Target#safe_notice}, and {Target#safe_action}.

      # formatting for bold, underline and so on, as well as color
      # codes. This does include removing the numeric arguments.
